                   <p> My research utilizes quantitative methods to probe whether and how phonologial representations may vary and change. To date my methods include 
                       acoustic analyses, and psycholinguistic paradigms, including priming, categorical perception, phonological judgment, and implicit attitudes tasks.

                            The impact of social change on phonological representeations  
                        </h2>
                        <p>My dissertation investigated the effects of social change on phonological representations (how the sounds of a language 
                            are mentally represented).  When a community undergoes a phonological change, individual speakers in the community
                            are changing the mental representation of their language.  It is currently unclear how phonological representations change.
                            Some argue that phonological change is the result of phonetic variation while others argue that phonetic variation need not be a precursor
                            to phonological change.  I analyze acoustic and psycholinguistic data to investigate the diachronic and synchronic spread of two 
                            phonological changes occuring in Michigan.  My findings suggest that phonological change is the result of phonetic variation compounded by social conditioning. 
                            This research adds to the growing field of sociophonology which finds 
                            that phonological representations can indeed act as sociolinguistic variables.

                            Changing Economies and Local Sound Change 
                        </h2>
                        <p>I am particularly interested in the social motivations for local dialect decline.  My research in this regard has analyzed vowel production data from a 
                            corpus of Lansing, Michigan speech (see description below) to investigate the links between economic and dialect 
                            decline in the area.  I conclude that the negative impact of shifting from manufacutring to service in the 1970s and 1980s 
                            had adverse affects on all things local to Lansing ... including the dialect.  As such, a social class divide 
                            developed in Lansing, whereby working-class speakers continued the local accent and middle-class speakers began to reject it.
                           I am currently investigating the links between these findings in Lansing and the similar economic and diaelct changes in 
                            other Rust Belt cities (e.g. Syracuse, NY and Detroit, MI). My preliminary analyses in Western Massachusettes also find 
                            similar linguistic changes starting in the same time frame as that found in Lansing. Keep an eye on this space for more details!   </p>

                            Sound Change in Progress 
                        </h2>
                        <p>In collaboraton with Dr. Suzanne Evans Wagner and my colleagues in the 
                            <a href="http://msusociolinguistics.weebly.com/">Michigan State Sociolinguistics Lab</a>, I have compiled a corpus of speech from
                            Lansing, Michgan natives born 1907-1997.  Our analysis of these recordings shows that the local dialect 
                            spoken in Michigan and surrounding states, the Northern Cities Shift, is declining.  This is an interesting finding in American dialectology because
                            until now, the Northern Cities Shift had been sited as one of the only sound changes still progressing in the United States.  
                            Visit the lab's website  to see all of the other amazing findings coming from this group!  </p>

                            Syllabic Representations
                        </h2>
                        <p>Evidence for syllabic representations are illusive.  
                            This is especially true for so-called ambisyllabic consonants, e.g. the /m/ in lemon.  Traditionally, there have been three major analyses for these consonants: 
                            they are onsets, codas, or linked to two syllables.  
                            Thus far, I have conducted a perception and production task to probe how ambisyllabic consonants in American English are represented.
                            Both suggest that ambisyllabic consonants are codas. The jury, of course, is still out.
